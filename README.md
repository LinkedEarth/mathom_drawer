# PaleoBooks

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks illustrating the use of software libraries maintained by [LinkedEarth](http://www.linked.earth). These notebooks can be uses as tutorials. They are fully executable through Binder (click on the badge at the top).

If you have suggestions for more examples, please submit an [issue](https://github.com/LinkedEarth/PaleoBooks/issues). If you want to contribute, please submit a pull request.

## Pyleoclim

[Pyleoclim](https://pyleoclim-util.readthedocs.io/en/master/) is a Python package geared towards timeseries analysis of time-uncertain data.

The package can (but do not necessarily have to) directly work with data in the Linked Paleo Data ([LiPD](https://lipd.net)) format. The advantage of working with that format is that the code contains automated data transformation, making working with paleoclimate data easier and faster.

## Citation
We needn't tell you that making research tools accessible requires time and effort. If you find any of these resources useful and use them in your own research, please do us the kindness of one or more citations. Notebooks in this collection is registered on Zenodo, and associated with a digital object identifier (DOI).  If you use any of the standards (LiPD) or the software (Pyleoclim), please cite them as well. It will make us (and NSF!) very happy to hear that these investments spawned more research.
